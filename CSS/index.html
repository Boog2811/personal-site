    <p>Hello everyone! This is a personal site for you to learn more about me and connect with me if desired!</p>
    <h2 class="blue-center">Education</h2>
    <p>I'm studying Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering.</p>
    <p>I'm a senior that's slated to graduate in May of 2025.</p>
    <h2 class="blue-center">Interests</h2>
    <p>I love video & board games, anything related to programming, and anything involving YouTube.</p>
    <h3>Video Games</h3>
    <p>I love many types of video games, but I especially love Incrementals & Social Deduction games.</p>
    <p>I actually host a modded Among Us lobby each week to share my love of Social Deduction games.</p>
    <h3>Youtube</h3>
    <p>Over the course of my life, I've spent a significant amount of time on platforms like YouTube, to the point where I love to have discussions about anything related to YouTube.</p>
    <p>Discussing YouTube is one of my favorite activities, and even though I don't do too much uploading myself (see my channel link below), I am relatively knowledgeable about many intricacies of creating on YouTube.</p>

    <h2>Plan for this Semester</h2>
    <p>For this semester, I plan to flesh out this page to hold more and more information about myself, eventually being able to make it into a personal site for people to learn more about me.</p>
