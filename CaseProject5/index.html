    <p>Hello everyone! This is a personal site for you to learn more about me and connect with me if desired!</p>
    <p>If you'd like to learn more about me, please go to the <a href="about.html">About</a> page!</p>
    <p>If you'd like to contact me, please go to the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page!</p>
    <!--Due to the addition of the other pages, most of the content of the site has been moved off of the Home/Index page, but this page will be populated with more as time passes.-->
    <h2>Plan for this Semester</h2>
    <p>For this semester, I plan to flesh out this page to hold more and more information about myself, eventually being able to make it into a personal site for people to learn more about me.</p>

    
    <p>Please type your name in the box below and then click the button.</p>
    <input type="text" id="name">
    <button type="button" id="alertButton">Click for a surprise!</button>

    
    <script>
        //This script creates a simple alert when the user clicks the button.
        //This is how the script knows when the button is pressed, and moves on to run the rest of the code inside the curly brackets
        document.getElementById("alertButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
            //This gets the text the user placed into the input field
            let name = document.getElementById("name").value;
            //This checks to make sure the user did type something into the box.
            if (name.trim() !== "") {
                //If they did type something in, the webpage responds with an alert saying hi and their name.
                alert("Hi " + name + "!")
            } else {
                //If the input field was empty, the webpage responds with an alert asking the user to type their name before clicking the button.
                alert("Please enter your name before clicking the button.")
            }
        });
    </script>
