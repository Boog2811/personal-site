    <!--Due to the addition of the other pages, most of the content of the site has been moved off of the Home/Index page, but this page will be populated with more as time passes.-->
    <h2>Plan for this Semester</h2>
    <p>For this semester, I plan to flesh out this page to hold more and more information about myself, eventually being able to make it into a personal site for people to learn more about me.</p>

    <h2>Recent Happenings</h2>
    <p>Recently, I've been playing a trivia game hosted on Discord called Quiz Planet, and it's been kinda funny. The questions are very clearly AI generated, although I hadn't come across one that was blatantly wrong yet. That was, until the other day...</p>

    <p>Below I've put a blurred image of the question I found, and you can click it to unblur and see the question. Although, I have to warn you first, it's painfully obvious that no one checked this question LOL</p>

    <!--This displays the blurred image. The blur is done within the image itself, not through any HTML/CSS/JS programming.-->
    <div class="lightbox-container">
        <img src="blurredQuestion.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="preview-image" id="preview">
    </div>

    <!--This brings the image to be fullscreen-->
    <div class="overlay" id="imageOverlay">
        <span class="close-btn" id="closeOverlay">&times;</span>
        <img src="unblurredQuestion.png" alt="Expanded Image" id="overlayImage">
    </div>

    <p>Yeah, that is not a thing that exists from the research I did after being shocked about a "drag" hotkey existing.</p>
