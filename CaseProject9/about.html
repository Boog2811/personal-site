    <h1 class="blue-center">About</h1>

    <h2 class="blue-center">Education</h2>
    <p>I'm studying Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering.</p>
    <p>I'm a senior that's slated to graduate in May of 2025.</p>
    <h2 class="blue-center">Interests</h2>
    <p>I love video & board games, anything related to programming, and anything involving YouTube.</p>
    <h3>Video Games</h3>
    <p>I love many types of video games, but I especially love Incrementals & Social Deduction games.</p>
    <p>I actually host a modded Among Us lobby each week to share my love of Social Deduction games.</p>
    <h3>Youtube</h3>
    <p>Over the course of my life, I've spent a significant amount of time on platforms like YouTube, to the point where I love to have discussions about anything related to YouTube.</p>
    <p>Discussing YouTube is one of my favorite activities, and even though I don't do too much uploading myself (click the image below to go to my channel!), I am relatively knowledgeable about many intricacies of creating on YouTube.</p>

    <h3>Number Systems & Linguistics</h3>
    <p>I also have an interest in linguistics, number systems, and really anything to do with how numbers work.
        This originated from some YouTube videos I watched (namely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qID2B4MK7Y0" target="_blank">a better way to count</a> by jan Misali), but the interest has grown over time to be one of my own.</p>
    <p>On aspect of this interest is how I love how prime numbers work, leading to a small creation on this site over on the <a href="primes.html">Prime Numbers</a> page.</p>
